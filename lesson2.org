* What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
To start tracking the files in there. This action creates a .git directory that
contains the git metadata.

* How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It offers total flexibility and control over the changes you would like to
commit each time.

* How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You can compare the changes made between the workinfg directory, staging area
and the last commits and make sure you make a commit by logical change.
* What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
When you are working in multiple features of the main project, for example
when you make a complete redesign of it but you'd like to keep the original
working. It also helps when you need to merge the changes.
