* When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Sureley the obvious answer is the moment you are involved in team
collaboration. But there are also ther reasons like working in an open-source
project, or simply wanting to show the world wha you're capable to do. WEll, and
whenever you need to access your files from another computer ;)
